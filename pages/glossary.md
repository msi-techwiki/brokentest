## Glossary

*   [Guardrails](#guardrails) A guardrail is a high-level rule that provides ongoing governance for your overall AWS environment. It's expressed in plain language. When users perform work in an AWS account in your landing zone, they're subject to guardrails.

*   [Landing Zone](#landingzone) Landing Zone is a solution that helps users more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. The UCSB Campus Cloud uses a landing zone solution to provide a multi-account environment.

*   [Namespace](#namespace) Define a namespace.

*   [Root User](#rootuser) When you first create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you begin with a single identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account __root__ __user__ and is accessed by signing in with the email address that you used when creating the account.
   We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the UCSB Single Sign On Account. Securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.
   To view the tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [AWS Tasks That Require Root User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html).

*   [Tags](#tags) A tag is a simple label consisting of a customer-defined key and an optional value that can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources. Although there are no inherent types of tags, they enable customers to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
