# Services

Here is a list of services that the Marine Science Institute offers to faculty, researchers and staff. 

## [Client Support](#support)

MSI ITS provides client support for those who are in MSI network spaces. This includes the Marine Science Building, the MSI Trailers, and the Love Lab. If you are not in one of those locations, your primary support will come from the department that is running your network. There is currently no charge for this service.

Please see the Documentation section for tutorials, hints, tips, and faqs.

Please use the HelpDesk to request client support.

### UCSB Connect - Communication, Calendaring & Collaboration Service

Connect is UCSB’s new communication and collaboration service. The core communication components include e-mail, calendaring, contacts, tasks, and mailing lists — with more to come as we expand. The collaboration suite is based on Microsoft’s Office365 platform and is hosted in "the cloud".

MSI ITS provides tier 1 support. Assisting in the account activation, and basic setup and configuration of email clients.

Currently, only the Email service has been implemented.

### Mailing Lists

MSI maintains a set of email lists to provide a way to communicate with the MSI community.

MSI no longer hosts these mailing lists in-house. Instead, we host these mailing lists through Google Groups. If you would like to be added to one of the Google Groups, please send a request through the MSI IT Help Desk. 

There are the building lists to alert users to location specific issues such as water or power outages. There is the MSI-News list which people can use as a general forum. Finally, there is the Currents mailing list, which hosts the MSI newsletter.

The General Lists:

### [Consultation](#consult)

*   Consult with your local IT staff. They may have processes and protocols in place for sharing responsibility for your AWS Account.
*   Consult with the Campus Cloud Team.

## [Budgeting](#budgeting)

Before you start the procurement process, you will need to estimate your monthly spend.

*   AWS Cost Calculator
    *   [Simple Monthly Calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
	  *   The new [Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/)

## [Procure an AWS Account](#procurement)

This is the first step for both new AWS accounts and existing AWS accounts that you wish to migrate to the Campus Cloud.
Follow the instructions below to ensure that an AWS account for UCSB business is covered under this agreement and in compliance with UC policy and applicable laws.

You will only be able to access the AWS services after all steps below are completed and the UCSB Campus Cloud team creates your AWS account.

1.  Log in to the UCSB Gateway Procurement System
2.  Complete the Campus Cloud Form.

   Please note the instructions on the left side of the form, and provide the requested information. Build in lead time for your start date. The estimated expenditure is for the duration of the PO.
   The expected duration is one year. The purchase order should then be renewed annually. If your procurement group is willing to support multi-year blankets, please limit your max duration to three years.
   The form is for the one Account. You can not request multiple accounts with a single form. You will want to fill out multiple forms and add them as line items in your cart.

3.  Add the completed form to your Cart.
     Verify that you have set the correct Commodity Code **81110000**

    and Object Code **7185**

   when you finalize your cart, check the Special Handling Code **GCT**

   and submit your requisition.

4.  The Campus Cloud team will receive your Purchase Order and contact you to schedule a meeting finalizing your account.
5.  After this meeting you will receive an activation email from AWS:
    *  Confirming that the account is set up for invoicing under the UC AWS agreement, and
    *  Providing final instructions to activate your account
6.  Assign users to your Account Groups.
7.  Your account will be billed through the Master Payer Account with consolidated billing. Any monthly costs will be charged against the Purchase Order you submitted.
8.  NOTE: As of May 16th 2020, you may use Sub 5 or Sub 7 in additional to the original requirement of Sub 3. 

### Troubleshooting the Procurement Process

 Did you requisition get returned with an error? Gateway will auto-return the requistion if any of the following is incorrect:

*   Special Handling Code __GCT__
*   Commodity Code __81110000__
*   Object Code __7185__.
