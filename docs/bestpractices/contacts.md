## AWS Account Contacts


### Primary Contact

Your AWS account will require detailed contact information. The primary contact email address is also the login used as the "root user"
You should prepare and fill in the contact information associated with your account, including your mailing address, telephone number, and website address.

Please see the following sample:
The primary contact email address is also the login used as the [root user]({{ site.baseurl }}/glossary)

```
Full Name: My UCSB Account
Address: UC Santa Barbara, Bldg 434  
City: Santa Barbara
State: CA
Postal Code: 93106
Country: US
Phone Number: 805-893-XXXX
Company Name: University of California, Santa Barbara
Website URL: *.ucsb.edu
```

For an individual user's aws account, using your @ucsb.edu email address as the primary email contact makes sense,
but for shared accounts it is recommended to use a [functional email address](https://www.connect.ucsb.edu/help/faq/what-functional-account)
or [google group](https://www.connect.ucsb.edu/usage/connect-mailing-list-service/connect-groups-mailing-list-service).

### Alternate (Secondary) Contacts

In order to keep the right people in the loop, you can add an alternate contact for Billing, Operations, and Security communications. The primary account holder will continue to receive all email communications.

You are required to fill in the alternate contacts including, full name, title, email address, and telephone Number.

*   Billing - The alternate Billing contact will receive billing-related notifications, such as invoice availability notifications.

*   Operations - The alternate Operations contact will receive operations-related notifications.

*   Security - The alternate Security contact will receive security notifications, including notifications from the AWS Abuse Team. For additional AWS security-related notifications, please access the Security Bulletins RSS Feed.

Check with your department for best practice. Your departmental IT should be included for at least one of the contacts.
Again, it is recommended to use [functional email address](https://www.connect.ucsb.edu/help/faq/what-functional-account) or [google group](https://www.connect.ucsb.edu/usage/connect-mailing-list-service/connect-groups-mailing-list-service).
